# Data_Sceince_Assignment-21
The dataset I chose is the affairs dataset that comes with Statsmodels. It was derived
from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook magazine, in which married women were
asked about their participation in extramarital affairs. More information about the study
is available in a 1978 paper from the Journal of Political Economy.
